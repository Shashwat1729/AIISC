Made exactly as instructed and found it to be savory with great depth of flavor. This Dijon and Cognac Beef Stew, while complex in flavor, is not difficult to prepare.
"This recipe is INCREDIBLE."  This true one-pot wonder of chicken, black beans, rice, tomatoes and chiles will make everyone at the table happy.
